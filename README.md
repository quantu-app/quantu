## Features

Quantu is a learning platform based on channels. Content creators can create a channel and post learning content to it. Learners across the platform can subscribe to channels and study the learning materials available on them.

### 1. Channels

Every user has a personal channel

### 2. Desk

Every user has a learning "Desk" that shows how many challenges they have completed or challenges they have marked to attempt later.

### 3. Challenges

Every channel has a list of challenges users can take.

There is an overview page (with pagination, like hacker news) where every user can see the newest challenges.
